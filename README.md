## Hi, I'm [Robert](https://robertdumitru.me/).

I'm a software engineer from Canada with nearly 5 years of experience, currently living and working in the SF Bay Area. I work primarily in Python and Typescript, and I'm exploring Go to add to my toolkit eventually.

The best way to get in touch is via [email](mailto:robert@altonsys.com).
